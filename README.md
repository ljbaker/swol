This is a dumb project I'm doing to kill time in the airport. I've been collecting data on my fitness performance at the gym for a while, and I'm going to see what trends (if any) I'm actually making.

In the rare event that someone actually sees this, please don't judge -- between COVID-19 and personally being hilariously injury prone, there are a lot of gaps in my routine that have hampered progress. Also I'm kind of inherently lazy.

Feel free to judge the quality of the code.
